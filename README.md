### Supported devices:

- HS100
- HS110

## Development Support

If you want to support the development of this app, especially if you have an unsupported TP-Link device, please enable debugging in the app settings.  
Please send me the debug log data in "Documents/harbour-kasa" folder on your device.

For testing unkown Devices I need you help. I will provide you some commands wich you can test inside the app, so please contact me for this. 
This option you find in the context menu of the device in device list page.
You need to add the device via IP address first.
Before sending the command in the app, it is a good idea to delete old debugging logs first.
After sending the commands, send me the files in "Documents/harbour-kasa".
